        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "-   Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm (style) based on the concept of “objects”.\n",
        "An object is a collection of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data.\n",
        "Instead of just writing code as a sequence of instructions, OOP lets you model real-world things — like a car, bank account, or student — as objects in code.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  What is a class in OOPs?\n",
        "- A class is a blueprint or template in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\n",
        "It defines how objects of that type will work — what data they have (attributes) and what actions they can perform (methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- An object is a real instance of a class.\n",
        "It’s a thing you create based on the class blueprint.\n",
        "It contains real data (attributes) and can perform actions (methods) defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "-  Abstraction → Hides complexity, shows only essential features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Focus: What something does.\n",
        "Example: Car dashboard hides engine details.\n",
        "\n",
        " Encapsulation → Hides data, restricts direct access.\n",
        "\n",

        "Dunder = Double UNDerscore\n",

        "These are special methods in Python with names like __init__, __str__, __len__ — they always start and end with two underscores.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "- nheritance is an OOP concept that lets one class reuse the properties and methods of another class.\n",
        "\n",
        "It creates a parent-child relationship:\n",
        "\n",
        "Parent class (base/super class) → the original class with common code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Child class (derived/sub class) → inherits stuff from the parent and can add or change things.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- In OOP, it lets different classes have methods with the same name, but with different behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- Encapsulation = Hiding internal data & restricting direct access, so you control how data is read or modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, you achieve this by:\n",
        "\n",
        " Using Private Attributes\n",

        "- A constructor is a special method in a class that runs automatically when you create an object.\n",

        " In Python, the constructor is always named __init__.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",

        "-  class method works with the class itself, not just an object.\n",

        " It has access to class variables and can modify them.\n",
        "\n",
        " Uses the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        " First parameter is always cls (not self).\n",
        "\n",
        " A static method does not care about class or instance — it’s just a regular function inside a class for organization.\n",

        " No self or cls.\n",

        "\n",
        "12.  What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "-  Method overriding means a child class defines a method that has the same name as a method in its parent class, but changes its behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- The @property decorator turns a method into a read-only attribute.\n",
        "It lets you access a method like an attribute, without parentheses.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism means “many forms” — it lets you use the same method name on different classes, and each class does it its own way.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class is a base class that cannot be directly instantiated.\n",

        "Use inheritance to reuse existing code instead of rewriting it.\n",
        "\n",

        "Show only relevant details, hide unnecessary complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "4️⃣ Encapsulation\n",
        "Protects data by keeping it hidden and controlled with methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "5️⃣ Polymorphism\n",
        "Same method name works in different ways — makes code flexible.\n",
        "\n",
        "6️⃣ Easier Maintenance\n",
        "Changes are easier — fix or update one class without breaking everything.\n",
        "\n",
        "7️⃣ Real-world Modeling\n",
        "Maps real-world things (cars, students, accounts) into code objects naturally.\n",

        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- Multiple inheritance means a **child class inherits from more than one parent class at the same time.\n",
        "\n",
        " The child class gets all the properties and methods from all its parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        " 19.  Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python\n",
        "-  __str__\n",
        "\n",
        "Defines the “nice” or user-friendly string version of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Used by print() and str().\n",
        "\n",
        " __repr__\n",
        "\n",
        "Defines the “official” or developer-friendly representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Should show enough detail to recreate the object, if possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "Used by repr() and the Python shell.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "-  super() is a built-in function that calls a method from the parent class (superclass).\n",
        "It’s mainly used in inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __del__ method is a special method called a destructor.\n",
        "It runs automatically when an object is about to be destroyed (garbage collected).\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "- A static method is just a regular function inside a class.\n",
        "It doesn’t need access to the class (cls) or the instance (self).\n",
        " Used for utility functions that logically belong to the class.\n",
        "\n",
        " A class method does work with the class itself.\n",
        " It takes cls as its first argument, not self.\n",
        " Can access and modify class variables that are shared by all instances.\n",
        "\n",
        " 23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        " - Polymorphism means one method name, but different behavior depending on the object’s class.\n",
        "\n",
        " In inheritance, a parent class defines a method, and child classes override it with their own version.\n",
        "\n",
        " 24.  What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        " - Method chaining means calling multiple methods one after another in a single line.\n",
        "Each method returns the object itself, so the next method can be called directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "25.  What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __call__ method is a special method that makes an object behave like a function."
